Deep Immersion is a library formalising a framework for simulating
denial-of-service (DoS) attacks against the Domain Name System (DNS), for the
express purpose of testing security features of highly performant and
abuse-aware DNS servers.

The library defines the components of such an attack simulator. These are:
  * "Sources" for generating domain names;
  * "DNS clients" for exchanging queries and responses with the DNS server
    under test, for each of those domain names;
  * "Inspectors" for evaluating those responses;
  * "Error handlers" for handling any errors encountered by those clients;
  * A "conductor" for controlling the rate and timing of those queries; and

A "driver" facilitates the flow of information between the components and
coordinates their concurrent execution. Multiple instances of the same type of
components can run in parallel if the driver is so configured.

From the perspective of the driver, all components are swappable. Various
components can therefore be written and the driver accordingly configured to
suit specific testing needs as long as those components conform to interface
definitions. It follows that many variants of Deep Immersion could emerge from
the combination of compatible components.

A minimal sample of the components can be found in their respective packages
with accompanying unit tests. More components could be added to those packages,
although implementers are free to import compliant components from elsewhere.

Besides the library, this repository also contains an initial variant of Deep
Immersion in the form of a command-line tool tailored to simulate pseudo-random
subdomain (PRSD) attacks on a server designed to respond to such attacks with
truncated responses. This particular implementation makes use of a "source"
generating many subdomains of a given domain, an "inspector" to conclude the
test upon detection of truncation, and a "conductor" to measure and throttle
the number of queries per second.

It provides the following options, with the default target server address set
to a safe default on the local host:

-client-addr string
  UDP host:port from which queries would be sent (default "127.37.98.54:35353")
-dns-clients uint
  Number of concurrent DNS clients to initialise (default 1)
-domain string
  Domain for which sub-domains would be generated (default "example.org.")
-error-handlers uint
  Number of error handlers to initialise (default 1)
-inspectors uint
  Number of response inspectors to initialise (default 1)
-log-interval uint
  Some k, such that every k-th event is logged (default 4096)
-max-qps uint
  Upper limit to number of queries per second (default 65536)
-server-addr string
  UDP host:port to which queries would be sent (default "127.46.140.94:5353")
-sources uint
  Number of sub-domain generators to initialise (default 1)
